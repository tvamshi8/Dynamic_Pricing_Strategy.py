What is Dynamic Pricing?
Dynamic Pricing is an application of Data Science that involves adjusting product or service prices based on various factors in real time. It is employed by businesses to optimize their revenue and profitability by setting flexible prices that respond to market demand, customer behaviour, and competitor pricing.

Using data-driven insights and algorithms, businesses can dynamically modify prices to achieve the most favourable outcomes.

For example, consider a ride-sharing company operating in a metropolitan area. The company wants to optimize its pricing strategy to maximize revenue and improve customer satisfaction. The traditional pricing model used by the business is based on fixed rates per kilometre, which does not account for fluctuations in supply and demand.

By implementing a dynamic pricing strategy, the company can leverage data science techniques to analyze various factors such as historical trip data, real-time demand, traffic patterns, and events happening in the area.

Using Machine Learning algorithms, the company can analyze data and adjust its prices in real-time. When demand is high, such as during rush hours or major events, the algorithm can increase the cost of the rides to incentivize more drivers to be available and balance the supply and demand. Conversely, during periods of low demand, the algorithm can lower the prices to attract more customers.

Dynamic Pricing Strategy: Overview
So, in a dynamic pricing strategy, the aim is to maximize revenue and profitability by pricing items at the right level that balances supply and demand dynamics. It allows businesses to adjust prices dynamically based on factors like time of day, day of the week, customer segments, inventory levels, seasonal fluctuations, competitor pricing, and market conditions.

To implement a data-driven dynamic pricing strategy, businesses typically require data that can provide insights into customer behaviour, market trends, and other influencing factors. So to create a dynamic pricing strategy, we need to have a dataset based on:

1. historical sales data
2. customer purchase patterns
3. market demand forecasts
4. cost data
5. customer segmentation data
6. real-time market data.

Dynamic Pricing Strategy using Python
Let’s start the task of building a dynamic pricing strategy by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset:

Exploratory Data Analysis
Let’s have a look at the descriptive statistics of the data:

Now let’s have a look at the relationship between expected ride duration and the historical cost of the ride:

Now let’s have a look at the distribution of the historical cost of rides based on the vehicle type:

Now let’s have a look at the correlation matrix:

Implementing a Dynamic Pricing Strategy
The data provided by the company states that the company uses a pricing model that only takes the expected ride duration as a factor to determine the price for a ride. Now, we will implement a dynamic pricing strategy aiming to adjust the ride costs dynamically based on the demand and supply levels observed in the data. It will capture high-demand periods and low-supply scenarios to increase prices, while low-demand periods and high-supply situations will lead to price reductions.

Now let’s calculate the profit percentage we got after implementing this dynamic pricing strategy:

Now let’s have a look at the relationship between the expected ride duration and the cost of the ride based on the dynamic pricing strategy:

Training a Predictive Model
Now, as we have implemented a dynamic pricing strategy, let’s train a Machine Learning model. Before training the model, let’s preprocess the data:

Summary
In a dynamic pricing strategy, the aim is to maximize revenue and profitability by pricing items at the right level that balances supply and demand dynamics. It allows businesses to adjust prices dynamically based on factors like time of day, day of the week, customer segments, inventory levels, seasonal fluctuations, competitor pricing, and market conditions.
